## Research Interests
My research interests lie in the fields of [stochastic analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stochastic_process) and its applications to [mathematical finance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_finance). In particular, now I'm working on [Limit Order Book Modelling](https://www.5minutefinance.org/concepts/the-limit-order-book) with a queueing system related to the Indian Stock Market with statistical techniques and tools and learning about the latest research advancements in the field of stochastic modeling 
## Overview
  I'm Abdul Rahman, a recent graduate with a Masterâ€™s degree in Mathematics from the prestigious Indian Institute of Technology Madras (IIT Madras), where I studied from 2022 to 2024. My academic journey has been driven by a profound interest in stochastic analysis and financial mathematics, areas that fascinate me due to their complex and impactful nature.

Prior to my Master's, I completed my undergraduate studies from 2018 to 2022 at Government Arts College. During my time there, I excelled academically and graduated as the department topper, an achievement that underscores my dedication and passion for mathematics.

Throughout my academic career, I have actively engaged in various projects and seminars that have deepened my understanding of mathematical concepts and their real-world applications. My coursework and research have equipped me with a solid foundation in stochastic processes, mathematical finance, and advanced statistical methods.

I'm always eager to learn and explore new mathematical theories and their applications, and I look forward to contributing to the field through research and professional endeavors.
